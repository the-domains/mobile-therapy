# Dry Needling

#### A skilled technique performed by physical therapists with specialized training. Available at select locations.

## What Is Dry Needling?

# 

Physical therapists with the appropriate training can provide the skilled technique of dry needling as part of a patient's treatment plan. Using a thin, solid filament needle to penetrate the skin, the goal is to create a local twitch response (LTR) in the muscle to cause a spontaneous contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers.

This has been shown to normalize the mechanical, electrical and biochemical components of muscles with myofascial dysfunction. Dry needling is different than acupuncture, and is based on the Western neuroanatomy and modern scientific study of the musculoskeletal system.
