            <title><![CDATA[ArthroStim]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>ArthroStim</h1><p>An ArthrostimÂ® adjustment involves the use of one of these special instruments. It has an appearance similar to a drill, and is held in a similar manner. What it does is produce a speedy thrust and recoil motion, similar to the way a chiropractor uses their hands to adjust the vertebrae in your back. The benefit of the instrument is that it performs this high-velocity, low-amplitude motion 12 times per second, and is targeted to a very small area. The force of the thrust radiates through the joint and the tissues that surround it, releasing trigger points that are often the cause of muscle spasms.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ca7d302366567562b562ae2c6c1efc201a142deb.png"></article>]]></description>
